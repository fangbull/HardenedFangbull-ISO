Hardened Fangbull is a security-focused distribution based on Arch Linux, structured in a multi-layered way against cyber attacks. The system runs with a hardened Linux kernel and includes many additional strict security settings. To provide protection against network-based external threats, the system uses the Great Fangbull Firewall as its configuration. This firewall only allows basic internet access; all other connections are strictly blocked. Hardened Fangbull does not support anonymization tools such as Tor, VPN, and Proxy. The system is installed via its own installer and provides high data security with full disk encryption. Hardened Fangbull aims to reduce the attack surface as much as possible.
